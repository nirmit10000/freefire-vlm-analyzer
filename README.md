# Free Fire VLM Analyzer

This project analyzes Garena Free Fire gameplay videos using the Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct vision-language model
running on a remote GPU virtual machine (VM) with vLLM.

- All coding is done locally on Windows.
- The VM is only used to run the model and scripts.
- Dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt` for reproducible environments.
